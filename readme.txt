This is an AndroidStudio-compatible version of the tutorial on managing the activity lifecycle.

I created it as follows.
0. Created an empty Android Studio project with no activity.
1. Inserted the manifest entries for the four activities in the tutorial provided by Google:
    https://developer.android.com/training/basics/activity-lifecycle/
2. Copied the tutorial's Java source files over, modifying the package names appropriately.
3. Copied the tutorials res/* files into/over the existing files.
